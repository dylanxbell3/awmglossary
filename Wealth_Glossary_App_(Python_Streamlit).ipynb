        "The \"ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" in `pd.Index.intersection` suggests an issue with the `sort` parameter within pandas' internal handling, potentially related to recent pandas versions or how the indices are being passed. While `sort` is not explicitly set, the default behavior might be causing the issue. A more robust way to combine series with potentially different indices is to use `pd.concat` and then resample or reindex. I will modify the code to use `pd.concat` to combine the series and then drop rows with any missing values after concatenation.\n",

This suggests an issue with how the initial `weighted_daily_returns` Series is being created or its compatibility with the operations that follow, possibly related to pandas versioning or internal type handling. Let's try initializing `weighted_daily_returns` as a DataFrame with zeros, matching the index and columns of `daily_returns`, to ensure type consistency and proper alignment during the weighted sum calculation. We can then sum along the columns to get the final weighted daily return Series.\n",

        "*   Basic validation ensures that the asset allocation percentages sum to 100%.\n",
        "*   Historical price data for representative tickers (^GSPC, AGG, GLD) was successfully acquired using `yfinance` and processed into a pandas DataFrame, handling missing values.\n",
        "*   Functions were developed to project historical portfolio performance and run Monte Carlo simulations based on user inputs and historical data.\n",
        "*   Logic was implemented to assess the feasibility of achieving a user-defined investment goal by analyzing the outcomes of the Monte Carlo simulations, calculating the probability of success and key statistics (median, 10th/90th percentiles).\n",
        "*   The projected historical performance and Monte Carlo simulation results, including summary statistics and a distribution plot, are displayed in the Streamlit UI.\n",
        "*   The new portfolio builder features were integrated into the existing Streamlit application alongside the glossary functionality, with code refactoring for improved clarity, organization, and maintainability.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Enhance the Monte Carlo simulation by allowing users to select different historical periods or use alternative models for generating simulated returns (e.g., GARCH models) to explore a wider range of potential market behaviors.\n",
        "*   Add features for portfolio rebalancing over time within the simulations or projections to provide a more realistic view of long-term performance under different strategies.\n"
